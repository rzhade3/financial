# Financial

If you're new to the world of personal finance, this is the place for you!

This site writes up the financial knowledge that I've learned about over the years.

It condenses knowledge that I've gained from other resources, like YouTube videos, prospectuses, Reddit and Investopedia into short TLDR chunks that are easy to digest, with links to learn about each topic in more depth.

## Development

This is a static site built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and served on GitHub Pages.

For local development, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo), then run `hugo serve --minify`.

Content to be modified is located in the `content/` folder.
