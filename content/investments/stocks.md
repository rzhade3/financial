# Stocks

**TLDR: Stocks are the ideal choice for investing if you have a medium risk tolerance and a lesser amount of money to invest. Many investment vessels, such as IRAs and 401ks are optimized for stock investments.**

Stocks represent ownership of a fraction of a company. This means that changes that affect the value of the company (such as a good quarter of sales) are also reflected in the stock price.

Stocks are traded on stock exchanges, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. In order to buy and sell stocks, you must create an account with a stock broker.
