# Savings

Savings are any amount of money that you have made but not spent over a given time. Savings may be used to prepare for emergencies, or to make bigger purchases down the line.

A general rule of thumb is to keep 3 to 6 months of expenses in savings for emergency purposes. However, depending on your risk tolerance and financial situation, you may want to save more or less.

The main criteria you should look for in a savings vessel are:

* zero risk of loss
* quick liquidity (easily convertible to cash)
* a reasonable amount of interest (**yield**)

There are a couple of different ways that you can store your savings. Read through the articles in this section for a description of each.
