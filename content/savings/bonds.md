# Bonds

**TLDR: Bonds (especially Treasury Inflation Bonds) are an excellent way to save money, if you know that you will not need the money for some time. Their yield far outpaces other financial tools for saving money, including High Yield Savings Accounts.**

Bonds are commonly known as a "boring" investment due to being guaranteed, low interest money. However, if one looks at bonds as a savings vessel instead of an investment one, the value proposition is a lot better.

In this article, we'll discuss the common ways to invest in bonds and how to choose the right one for your needs. As this section is about savings, we'll specifically discuss bonds with a maturity cliff of one year or less.
