This period is called a \u0026ldquo;maturity period\u0026rdquo;, and can vary from anywhere from a couple months to several years.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a CD, there are two main factors you should consider:\n the interest rate the early withdrawal penalty  In case you do need money sooner due to a future emergency, you should check how much the bank penalizes you for withdrawing early.    There\u0026rsquo;s no tax incentive for CDs, however there\u0026rsquo;s also no maximum that you can put into it in a given year. So, if you have money in a normal savings account that you don\u0026rsquo;t think you need for a while, you should put it into a CD.\nFurther Reading #   https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/what-is-a-cd-ladder  A guide to an efficient way of \u0026ldquo;stacking\u0026rdquo; CDs for steady, regular access to money   https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/best-5-year-cd-rates/  A list of the best CD rates for a 5 year maturity period (you can also filter by other periods)    "},{"id":1,"href":"/financial/investments/crypto/","title":"Cryptocurrency","section":"Investments","content":"Cryptocurrency #  TLDR: Cryptocurrency is an extremely speculative investment that is good to round out your investment portfolio.

While the yield is lower than storing in other places, this kind of account guarantees liquidity for your money.\nA high yield savings account is a savings account by a bank that is designed to give you a higher yield than other savings accounts. This type of account is typically offered by banks with low overhead, such as online-only banks.\nWhile a typical savings account may offer you only 0.06% - 0.1% interest, a high yield savings account can offer you a significantly higher yield around 0.5%.1\nTo illustrate this difference, if one were to save $1000 in both accounts over 10 years, you\u0026rsquo;d make $6 in a normal account vs $50 in a high yield account!\nExamples #  Some good examples of high yield savings accounts include:\n Ally Bank Goldman Sachs Alliant  The key to getting the best interest rate is to shop around!\nFurther Reading #   https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/high-yield-online-savings-accounts https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/09/high-yield-savings-account.asp    Numbers as of 16 January 2022\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "},{"id":3,"href":"/financial/investments/","title":"Investments","section":"Index","content":"Investments #  This section discusses common investment vessels.

Their yield far outpaces other financial tools for saving money, including High Yield Savings Accounts, while also having basically no risk.\nA bond is an IOU issued by the government (or some other entity) to a lender (you). This IOU comes with conditions such as a guaranteed rate of interest and a date at which it will be paid back (maturity date).\nBy buying bonds, you can lock in interest rates higher than offered by banks with the same level of risk (the federal government guarantees repayment).\nKinds of Bonds #  There are several different kinds of bonds1. However, the kind that is most applicable to you (an individual investor) are savings bonds.\nSavings bonds are bonds issued by the government for individual investors. You can purchase them in small lots (the current minimum lot size is $25), with the same perks offered by normal Treasury Bonds.\nIt is important to note that there is a maximum lot size that can be purchased in any given calendar year. As such, if you have a large amount of savings, you may not be able to put all of it into savings bonds. View the Treasury website for more information.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s two types of Savings Bonds.\nI Bond #  The I Bond is a type of savings bond whose rate of interest is tied to the rate of inflation. Its interest rate changes every 6 months to be pegged to the current inflation rate. This means that your money is guaranteed not to depreciate due to inflation. As such, this is a fantastic way to save money.\nEE Bond #  The EE Bond is a type of savings bond with a fixed rate of interest.\nIt is noteworthy that if you hold onto an EE bond for 20 years, your money will be doubled, regardless of the initial fixed interest rate. This works out to an interest rate of around 3.6%, significantly better than a bank\u0026rsquo;s interest rate, and slightly greater than historical inflation averages of 3.2%.\nFurther Reading/ Links #   https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-bonds-3305600 https://treasurydirect.gov/  Government website for buying Treasury bonds https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_ibonds_glance.htm      https://www.thebalance.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-bonds-3305600\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "},{"id":7,"href":"/financial/investments/stocks/","title":"Stocks","section":"Investments","content":"Stocks #  TLDR: Stocks are the ideal choice for investing if you have a medium risk tolerance and a lesser amount of money to invest.

This means that changes that affect the value of the company (such as a good quarter of sales) are also reflected in the stock price.\nStocks are traded on stock exchanges, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ.
